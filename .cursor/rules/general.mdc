### Development Environment

The local development environment is completely contained within the `/dev` directory.

- This includes the `docker-compose.yml`, the `build-local.sh` script, test media folders, and the `jellyfin-data` directory. The build script is configured to use a separate `meta-dev.json` file and handles all necessary paths for a local build. Do not modify files outside of `/dev` for local testing.
