A rebuilt and modernized plugin to create smart, rule-based playlists in Jellyfin.

### Using the Web Interface

The web interface is organized into three tabs:

1.  **Create Playlist**: This is where you build new playlists.
    -   Define the rules for including items.
    -   Choose the sort order.
    -   Select which user should own the playlist.
    -   Decide if the playlist should be public or private.
    -   Choose whether or not to enable the playlist.
2.  **Manage Playlists**: View and edit all of your existing smart playlists.
    -   See the rules, sorting, and other details for each playlist.
    -   Edit existing playlists to modify rules, ownership, or settings.
    -   Enable or disable playlists to show or hide them in Jellyfin.
    -   Delete playlists you no longer need with flexible deletion options.
3.  **Settings**: Configure global settings for the plugin.
    -   Set the default sort order for new playlists.
    -   Manually trigger a refresh for all smart playlists.

#### Flexible Deletion Options

When deleting a smart playlist, you can choose whether to also delete the corresponding Jellyfin playlist:

- **Delete both (default)**: Removes both the smart playlist configuration and the Jellyfin playlist
- **Delete configuration only**: Keeps the Jellyfin playlist and removes the "[Smart]" suffix, making it a regular manually managed playlist

This is useful when you for example want to populate a playlist automatically once, then manage it manually.

### Automatic Updates

Smart playlists automatically refresh when:
- The "Refresh all SmartPlaylists" scheduled task runs
- You manually trigger the task from the Jellyfin dashboard

## Overview

This plugin creates smart playlists that automatically updates based on rules you define, such as:

- **Unplayed movies** from specific genres
- **Recently added** series or episodes
- **High-rated** content from certain years
- **Music** from specific artists or albums
- **Tagged content** like "Christmas", "Kids", or "Documentaries"
- And much more!

The plugin features a modern web-based interface for easy playlist management - no technical knowledge required.

## How to Install

### From Repository
Add this repository URL to your Jellyfin plugin catalog:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-plugin-manifest/master/manifest.json
```

### Manual Installation
Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin/releases) and extract it to your Jellyfin plugins directory.

## üöÄ Roadmap

Here are some of the planned features for future updates. Feel free to contribute or suggest new ideas!

- **More Rule Fields**: Add additional fields if needed, [request here](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin/issues).
- **Auto refresh**: Make smart playlists update automatically on library changes instead of a fixed schedule.
- **Caching**: Look into a cache solution to increase performance.
- **Connect playlist ID**: Connect smart playlists to Jellyfin playlists by ID instead of name. Would also include updating existing playlists instead of recreating.

## Development

### Building Locally
For local development, see the [dev folder](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin/tree/master/dev)

## Advanced Configuration

### Available Fields

The web interface provides access to all available fields for creating playlist rules:

#### **Content Fields**
- **Name** - Title of the media item
- **Media Type** - The type of item (e.g., `Movie`, `Episode`, `Series`, `Audio`)
- **Audio Languages** - The audio language of the movie/TV show.
- **Album** - Album name (for music)
- **Folder Path** - Location in your library

#### **Playback Fields**
- **Is Played** - Whether the item has been watched/listened to
- **Is Favorite** - Whether the item is marked as a favorite
- **Play Count** - Number of times the item has been played
> **Note:** These playback fields can optionally be set to a specific user. This allows you to create rules like "Is Played by user X" or "Is Favorite for user X AND for user Y".

#### **Content Info**
- **Parental Rating** - Age rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.)
- **Runtime (Minutes)** - Duration of the content in minutes

#### **Ratings & Dates**
- **Community Rating** - User ratings (0-10)
- **Critic Rating** - Professional critic ratings
- **Production Year** - Original production year
- **Release Date** - Original release date of the media
- **Date Created** - When added to your library
- **Date Last Refreshed** - Last metadata update
- **Date Last Saved** - Last saved to database
- **Date Modified** - Last file modification

> **Date Filtering**: Date fields support both exact date comparisons and relative date filtering:
> - **Exact dates**: Use "Greater Than" or "Less Than" with a specific date (e.g., "2024-01-01")
> - **Relative dates**: Use "Newer Than" or "Older Than" with a time period (e.g., "3 weeks", "1 month", "2 years")
> 
> **Note**: Relative date calculations use UTC time to ensure consistent behavior across different server timezones. This means "items from the last 3 days" is calculated from the current UTC time, not your local timezone.

#### **Metadata**
- **People** - Cast and crew (actors, directors, producers, etc.)
- **Genres** - Content genres
- **Studios** - Production studios
- **Tags** - Custom tags assigned to media items

### Available Operators

- **Equals** / **Not Equals** - Exact matches
- **Contains** / **Not Contains** - Partial text matching
- **Greater Than** / **Less Than** - Numeric comparisons
- **Greater Than or Equal** / **Less Than or Equal** - Numeric comparisons (not available for date fields)
- **Newer Than** / **Older Than** - Relative date comparisons (days, weeks, months, years)
- **Matches Regex** - Advanced pattern matching using .NET regex syntax

#### Regex Pattern Examples

The plugin uses **.NET regex syntax** (not JavaScript, Perl, or other flavors):

- **Case-insensitive matching**: `(?i)swe` (matches "swe", "SWE", "Swe")
- **Multiple options**: `(?i)(eng|en)` (matches "eng", "en", "ENG", etc.)
- **Starts with**: `^Action` (title starts with "Action")
- **Ends with**: `2023$` (ends with "2023")
- **Contains numbers**: `\d+` (contains one or more digits)
- **Scandinavian languages**: `(?i)(swe|nor|dan|fin)`

**Note**: Do not use JavaScript-style regex like `/pattern/flags` - use .NET syntax instead.

**Test your patterns:** Use [Regex101.com with .NET flavor](https://regex101.com/?flavor=dotnet) to test and debug your regex patterns before using them in smart playlists.

### Sorting Options

- **No Order** - Items appear in library order
- **Release Date**
- **Production Year**
- **Community Rating**
- **Ascending** - Oldest first
- **Descending** - Newest first

### Rule Logic

- **Within a Rule Group**: All conditions must be true (AND logic)

### Manual Configuration (Advanced Users)

For advanced users who prefer JSON configuration, playlist files are stored in the `data/smartplaylists` directory. See `example.playlist.json` for the file format.

## Credits

This project is a fork of the original SmartPlaylist plugin created by **[ankenyr](https://github.com/ankenyr)**. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin). All credit for the foundational work and the core idea goes to him.

## Disclaimer

The vast majority of the recent features, including the entire web interface and the underlying API changes in this plugin, were developed by an AI assistant. While I do have some basic experience with C# from a long time ago, I'm essentially the project manager, guiding the AI, fixing its occasional goofs, and trying to keep it from becoming self-aware. If you find a bug, it was probably the AI's fault. If you like a feature, the AI will begrudgingly accept your praise. Use at your own risk!
