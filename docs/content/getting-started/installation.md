# Installation

## From Repository

Add this repository URL to your Jellyfin plugin catalog:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-plugin-manifest/main/manifest.json
```

## Manual Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin/releases) and extract it to a subfolder in your Jellyfin plugins directory (for example `/config/plugins/SmartPlaylist`).

## Try RC Releases (Unstable)

Want to test the latest features before they're officially released? You can try release candidate (RC) versions using the unstable manifest:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-plugin-manifest/unstable/manifest.json
```

!!! warning "RC Releases"
    RC releases are pre-release versions that may contain bugs or incomplete features. Use at your own risk and consider backing up your smart playlist configurations before upgrading.
