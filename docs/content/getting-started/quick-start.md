# Quick Start

## Creating Your First List

1. **Access Plugin Settings**: Go to Dashboard → My Plugins → SmartLists
2. **Navigate to Create List Tab**: Click on the "Create List" tab
3. **Configure Your List**:
   - Enter a name for your list
   - Choose whether to create a Playlist or Collection
   - Select the media type(s) you want to include
   - Add rules to filter your content
   - Choose sorting options (playlists only - collections don't support sorting)
   - Set the list owner (for playlists) or reference user (for collections)
   - Configure other settings as needed

!!! tip "Playlists vs Collections"
    For a detailed explanation of the differences between Playlists and Collections, see the [Configuration Guide](../user-guide/configuration.md#playlists-vs-collections).

## Example: Unwatched Action Movies

Here's a simple example to get you started:

**List Name**: "Unwatched Action Movies"

**List Type**: Playlist

**Media Type**: Movie

**Rules**:
- Genre contains "Action"
- Is Played = False

**Sort Order**: Production Year (Descending)

**Max Items**: 100

This will create a playlist of up to 100 unwatched action movies, sorted by production year with the newest first.
