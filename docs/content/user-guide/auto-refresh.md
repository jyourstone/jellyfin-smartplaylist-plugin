# Auto-Refresh

Smart playlists and collections can update automatically in multiple ways.

## Real-Time Auto-Refresh

Configure lists to refresh automatically when your library changes:

- **Per-List Setting**: Each list can be set to `Never`, `On Library Changes`, or `On All Changes`
- **Global Default**: Set the default auto-refresh mode for new lists in Settings
- **Unified Batching**: All changes use intelligent 3-second batching to prevent spam during bulk operations
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses advanced caching to only refresh lists that are actually affected by changes
- **Automatic Deduplication**: Multiple events for the same item are combined into a single refresh

### Auto-Refresh Modes

- **Never**: Scheduled and manual refresh only (original behavior)
- **On Library Changes**: Refresh only when new items are added to your library
- **On All Changes**: Refresh for library additions AND all updates (metadata changes, playback status, favorites, etc.)

## Custom List Scheduling

Configure individual lists with their own refresh schedules:

- **Per-list scheduling**: Each list can have its own schedule
- **Schedule types**: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, or Interval
- **Flexible intervals**: 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, or 24 h
- **Backward compatible**: Existing lists continue using legacy Jellyfin scheduled tasks

### Schedule Options

- **Daily**: Refresh at a specific time each day (e.g., 3:00 AM)
- **Weekly**: Refresh on a specific day and time each week (e.g., Sunday at 8:00 PM)
- **Monthly**: Refresh on a specific day and time each month (e.g., 1st at 2:00 AM)
- **Yearly**: Refresh on a specific month, day and time each year (e.g., January 1st at midnight)
- **Interval**: Refresh at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 hours, every 30 minutes)
- **No schedule**: Disable all scheduled refreshes (auto-refresh and manual only)

!!! tip "Multiple Schedules"
    You can add multiple schedules to a single list. For example, you could set both a Daily schedule at 6:00 AM and an Interval schedule every 4 hours to refresh the list both at a specific time and at regular intervals throughout the day.

## Legacy Scheduled Tasks

!!! warning "Deprecated and Removed"
    Legacy scheduled tasks have been deprecated and removed. The original Jellyfin scheduled tasks (Audio SmartLists and Media SmartLists) are no longer used. All lists now use the custom scheduling system described above, or rely on auto-refresh and manual refresh only.

## Example Use Cases

### Custom Scheduling Examples

- **Daily Random Mix**: Random-sorted playlist with a Daily schedule at 6:00 AM → fresh random order every morning
- **Weekly Discoveries**: New-content playlist with a Weekly schedule on Sunday at 8:00 PM → weekly refresh for weekend planning
- **Monthly Archive**: Year-based movie playlist with a Monthly schedule on the 1st at 2:00 AM → monthly refresh for archival content
- **Background Refresh**: Mood-based music playlist with 4-hour intervals → regular updates without being intrusive

### Auto-Refresh Examples

- **Continue Watching**: NextUnwatched playlist with auto-refresh on all changes → updates when episodes are watched (batched)
- **New Releases**: Date-based list with auto-refresh on library changes → updates when new content is added
- **Favorites Collection**: Favorite-based collection with auto-refresh on all changes → updates when items are favorited/unfavorited (batched)

### Mixed Approach

Combine both systems for optimal performance:

- Use **custom scheduling** for lists that benefit from regular refresh (random order, time-based rules)
- Use **auto-refresh** for lists that need immediate updates (playback status, new additions)

## Scheduled Refresh Control

Perfect for randomized lists:

- Enable scheduled refresh for randomized lists to get fresh random order daily/hourly
- Disable for rule-based lists that rely on real-time auto-refresh instead
- Mix and match: some lists on schedule, others auto-refresh only

## Manual Refresh

- Use the **"Refresh All Lists"** button in the Settings tab to trigger a refresh of all lists
- Use the **"Refresh"** button next to each list in the Manage Lists tab to refresh individual lists

!!! note "Refresh Time"
    A full refresh of all lists can take some time depending on how many media items and lists you have. Large libraries with many lists may take several minutes or even hours to complete, depending on the hardware. Individual list refreshes are typically faster.

!!! tip "Monitor Refresh Progress"
    When you click "Refresh All Lists", you'll be automatically redirected to the **Status** page where you can monitor the progress of all refresh operations in real-time. The Status page shows ongoing operations with progress bars, estimated time remaining, and detailed refresh history. See the [Configuration](configuration.md#3-status) guide for more details.

## Performance Considerations

### Auto-Refresh Settings

- **`Never`**: Best performance, no automatic refreshes
- **`On Library Changes`**: Good performance, refreshes only for library additions
- **`On All Changes`**: Refreshes for additions AND updates (metadata, playback status, etc.)

### Large Library Recommendations

- All changes are automatically batched with a 3-second delay to prevent spam during bulk operations
- Even `On All Changes` is efficient thanks to intelligent batching during large library scans
- **Removed items** are automatically handled by Jellyfin (no refresh needed)
- Consider limiting the number of lists with auto-refresh enabled to optimize server performance

### Third-Party Plugin Compatibility

- Plugins that sync watched status may trigger many simultaneous updates
- If you experience performance issues during bulk sync operations, temporarily set lists to `Never` or `On Library Changes`
