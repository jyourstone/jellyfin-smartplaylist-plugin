# Building Locally

For local development, see the [dev folder](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin/tree/main/dev) in the repository.

The development environment is contained in the `/dev` directory. Use `./build-local.sh` from `/dev` for builds. Don't modify files outside `/dev` for local testing.
